Note: Yes, this is an app helping students to determine at which dining hall on a particular campus that they will eat at, based on the food being served at a particular time and location, as well as the student's preferences. Because the student type in the food into the search bar and data is stored with an online database, there is no need to use web crawlers or any Computer Science tools that would violate a websites Terms of Service (TOS)/



While the following isn't a coding project, it's worth mentioning here:

Using Notion to host my modified version of getting things done (GTD) has been very impactful in my productivity. Which translates into creating more CS projects in a given amount of time. In addition, all of the logic and thinking that I have invested into developing this digital system makes it noteworthy on Github. Enjoy.
