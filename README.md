# breakProjects

here is a demo of one of projects I have done over break:

App name: DiningBuddy
Purpose: This is an app helping students to determine at which dining hall on a particular campus that they will eat at, based on the food being served at a particular time and location, as well as the student's preferences. 

Note: In developing the app, I was careful not to violate any website Terms of Service (TOS).

While the following isn't a coding project, it's worth mentioning here:

Using Notion to host my modified version of getting things done (GTD) has been very impactful in my productivity. Which translates into creating more CS projects in a given amount of time. In addition, all of the logic and thinking that I have invested into developing this digital system makes it noteworthy on Github. Enjoy.
